# Quick Sort Algorithm

 This Java program demonstrates the implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm. Quick Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to efficiently sort an array.

# Quick Sort Implementation
The Main class contains the quickSort method for sorting an array using the Quick Sort algorithm. The partition method is used to partition the array and return the index of the pivot. The print method is a utility function to print the elements of an array.

## Input Array:

- Enter the size of the array when prompted.
- Input the elements of the array one by one.
