# Heap Sort Algorithm

This Java program demonstrates the implementation of the Heap Sort algorithm. Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure.

## How Heap Sort Works

1. **Build Heap:**
   - The program builds a max heap by rearranging the array elements.

2. **Sort Array:**
   - It repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and places it at the end of the array.
   - The heap is then reduced in size, and the process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.
