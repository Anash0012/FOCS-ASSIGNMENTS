# Stack Implementation in Java
 This Java program demonstrates a basic implementation of a stack with operations such as push, pop, peek, and checking if the stack is empty.

## Stack Class
The Stack class includes the following methods:

- push(int x): Pushes an element onto the stack.
- pop(): Pops and returns the top element from the stack.
- peek(): Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
- isEmpty(): Checks if the stack is empty.
