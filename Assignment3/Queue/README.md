# Queue Implementation in Java

This Java program demonstrates a basic implementation of a queue with operations such as enqueue, dequeue, peek, and checking if the queue is empty.

## Queue Class
The Queue class includes the following methods:

- enqueue(int x): Enqueues an element into the queue.
- dequeue(): Dequeues and returns the front element from the queue.
- peek(): Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.
- isEmpty(): Checks if the queue is empty.
